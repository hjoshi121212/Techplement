Created a Weather App Dashboard using Html, Css, Javascript.


I have developed a basic and responsive Weather-app-dashboard which in real time records the current Temperature at anywhere in this world , even the smallest cities. This project aims to help users get through the basic development of front end using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The weather app dashboard utilizes 1. HTML for defining elements such as search bars, buttons, and sections for displaying weather information, 2. CSS for styling and ensuring responsiveness, 3. JavaScript for handling user inputs, sending API requests, and dynamically updating the DOM with weather data
